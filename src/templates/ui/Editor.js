Emma is at @Moma's homepage. After briefly scanning the page she decides that the Explore Architecture section might be the best place to start rather than search.

She sees options to view ="Feature Based Content" and also an area called ="Themes with Links" to the various themes.

Emma chooses to @"Browse by Style" having seen some of the Art Deco pictures in her original search.
